# Advanced FAQ
## Will KyraAV ever be officially supported on v2sp1 or lower?
No.

## Can KyraAV run on Windows 96 v1/v0.5?
Officially? No.

Technically? With some heavy modifications to [v321](https://github.com/themirrazz/v321), the Web Shield will work. Preferences, Virus Shield, Behavior Shield, Camera Shield, auto-update, and tamper protection WILL NOT WORK AT ALL!!!!
