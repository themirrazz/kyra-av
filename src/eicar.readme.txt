We've included the EICAR Antivirus Test File (eicar.com.txt). This program triggers KyraAV (among other antivirus) but is NOT malicious. You can open it in Textpad (or your favorite TXT editor/viewer) to trigger KyraAV.

If KyraAV doesn't trigger when you open the file, or triggers even when Virus Shield is off, please open an issue on our GitHub.

You can use the app 'webcam-shield-tester' to test webcam shield.
